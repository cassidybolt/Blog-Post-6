This week’s focus on physical computing and connective messaging definitely has been my favorite unit thus far. Although I personally had a lot of challenges figuring out FaceOSC, I found the technology behind it to be so incredible. That being said, I was quite excited to discover that Nike had actually utilized these concepts for an interactive digital art installation of their own. 

The piece was displayed at the Milan Design Week and uses Microsoft Kinect technology to mimic human bodies interacting with the digital screen. The design company that created the piece, Universal Everything, sought to find a way to turn the human body into digital artwork. It functions by copying human movements, which then displays colored lights on a screen. The video linked below shows the extraordinary visuals that one can create by moving his or her body.

One of the reasons I really love this piece and this technology in general is because I am very passionate about mind and body connection. As a personal fitness trainer, I strive to educate my clients on how to live in tune with their bodies. We often tend to criticize our bodies, forgetting that they merely exist as vehicles for our souls. However, I think that interactive artwork such as the Nike piece reminds us of how powerful our bodies are. During our daily lives, it is easy to forget about the beauty of movement as it is not necessarily visually apparent to us. Through interactive installations, one is capable of actually viewing the beauty instilled in how our 
bodies move.

I also was extremely drawn to the Saatchi Gallery’s “selfie exhibition,” which uses facial recognition algorithms to detect viewers’ faces and display them 35 times larger. It then is projected on different scales and angles where you can view yourself as digital art. Dubbed the “Zoom Pavilion,” the exhibit strives to flip the “sinister act of surveillance” on its head. The article below provides further information on the interactive piece and other similar exhibits.
